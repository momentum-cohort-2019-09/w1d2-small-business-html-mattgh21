            <li>Wild hyacinth:
                <p>This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The 
                    bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. 
                    It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and 
                    on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or 
                    prairies. Additionally it is found growing 
                    alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be 
                    divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. 
                    Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. 
                    Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than 
                    by runners.

            <li>Lily-of-the-Valley:
                <p>With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge 
                    bells that dangle above bright emerald-green 
                    leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover 
                    appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. 
                    But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, 
                    spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who 
                    gardens in a small space will want to watch this 
                    perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. 
                    Tolerates shade well. <strong>Warning: this 
                    plant is poisonous.</strong></p>

            <li>Crown Imperials:
                <p>Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, 
                    making rapid growth in the spring, flowering during 
                    April/early May and dying down in early summer. 
                    Best in raised beds or planters. Does not tolerate 
                    shade; needs a warm, sunny position where it can 
                    be left undisturbed for many years. 
                </p>

            <li>Persian buttercup:
                <p>This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall 
                    and has large showy blooms in a variety of colors 
                    from May to June. Persian buttercups are most 
                    commonly grown from tubers planted in the beginning 
                    of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms 
                    in a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate 
                    light frost.</p>

            <li>Spring starflower:
                <p>These charming little blooming plants hail from 
                    Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of 
                    perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums 
                    away. These flowers spring from fall planted 
                    bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with 
                    a similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous 
                    flowering stems with slender, deeply green 
                    foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped 
                    with six blue or white petals.</p>

            <li>Tulips:
                <p>We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. 
                    Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before 
                    a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 
                    60 degrees F.</p>
